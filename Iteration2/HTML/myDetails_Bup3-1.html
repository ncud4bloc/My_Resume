        I've had a rewarding engineering career working as a structural analyst in the aerospace & automotive industries. Much of this experience is directly applicable to other types of work and, more specifically, to Web Development.<br><br> I've become very skilled at learning, and quickly reaching proficiency with, specialized and complex software packages, and am quite comfortable presenting my work to large audiences. Furthermore, my past work required the ability to interact tactfully with individuals from multiple organizations and diverse disciplines, and my abilities in this regard were singled out as a model for emulation.<br><br> I feel that these attributes would enable me to quickly become a strong asset to any organization.

        I am originally from Detroit, Michigan but my Irish parents moved the family to Ireland when I was seven, and I lived there just outside of Dublin until returning to the U.S. for high school. I attended high school and college in Michigan, and moved to Los Angeles after earning my college degree.<br><br>  Most of the next several years were spent living in the Los Angeles and San Francisco suburbs working as an aerospace engineer until 2014, when my wife, daughter, and myself "cashed out" of silicon valley and relocated to Mesa, Arizona.  We love it here and, except for the occasional trip back to Ireland to visit family, we're staying!

        I love flying and am also an avid motorcyclist.  I enjoy working out in the gym and getting together with friends for group activities.  My wife and I also like taking hikes in the local desert and going on extended road-trips exploring the west.  And finally, when at home I love to relax with a good book, and am typically reading two or three books at any given time.
