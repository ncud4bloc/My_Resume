    <p class="textBG">I have enjoyed a 25 year engineering career working as a structural analyst in the aerospace & automotive industries. Much of this experience is directly applicable to other types of work and, more specifically, to Web Development. I've become very skilled at learning and quickly reaching proficiency with specialized and complex software packages and am quite comfortable presenting my work to large audiences. Furthermore, my past work required the ability to interact tactfully with individuals from multiple organizations and diverse disciplines, and my abilities in this regard were singled out as a model for emulation. I feel that these attributes would enable to quickly become a strong asset to any organization.
